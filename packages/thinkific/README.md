# @corsair-dev/thinkific

Thinkific Admin API v1 integration for Corsair. The route and data contracts follow Thinkific's [official OpenAPI v1 export](https://developers.thinkific.com/openapi/thinkific-admin-api-v1.yaml).

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @corsair-dev/thinkific
```

## Authentication

Configure the Thinkific API key and the site's subdomain. The plugin sends the documented `X-Auth-API-Key` and `X-Auth-Subdomain` headers to `https://api.thinkific.com/api/public/v1`. Corsair stores the site subdomain as the account's `tenant_external_id`; the API key is resolved through `ctx.key`. API keys require a Thinkific plan with API access.

## Operations

The operation arguments are strict and grouped as `{ path, query, body }` according to the provider route. Path values are required where shown; query parameters preserve Thinkific's names (including `query[email]`).

## Pagination, rate limits, and errors

- Collection routes accept the documented `page` and `limit` query parameters when present in the OpenAPI operation. Thinkific's REST guide states a default limit of 25 and maximum of 250. Collection responses use `items` and `meta.pagination`.
- Thinkific documents a limit of 120 requests per minute per site and at most 10 concurrent requests. HTTP 429 responses may include `RateLimit-Reset` as an epoch time; Corsair's shared transport honors this reset header and retries 429s. Other errors and writes are not retried automatically by this plugin.
- Request objects reject undocumented fields; successful response bodies are checked against the OpenAPI v1 response schemas. Error messages are sanitized so request bodies, query values, email addresses, and credentials are not copied into thrown errors or logs.

## Scope and exclusions

- This plugin targets only the officially documented Thinkific Admin API v1 at `/api/public/v1`. Admin API v2 is not verified by the official Admin reference/export.
- Webhook management and incoming webhook receivers are excluded. Thinkific's separate [Webhooks API reference](https://developers.thinkific.com/api/webhooks-api) does not publish route-level request/response contracts and uses a separate Bearer-auth surface.
- These five Site Scripts routes are excluded because Thinkific requires a public app and OAuth `write:site_scripts` scope; this plugin uses the API-key auth model: `GET /site_scripts`, `POST /site_scripts`, `GET /site_scripts/{id}`, `PUT /site_scripts/{id}`, and `DELETE /site_scripts/{id}`.
- Thinkific's REST introduction notes that new-course-builder courses are excluded from almost all REST endpoints.
